# GNU/Linux, Unix, MacOS terminal based system

This project is attempt to recreate Unix like Terminal-based environment.

This is not Emulator, you will not be able to compile and run C++ programs. Instead this is a model of Unix system (GNU/Linux or MacOS), where things in the system are implemented in JavaScript.

This can be nice way to learn how Unix system works if you read the code. But also you will be able to play with terminal based Linux in browser.

The system will run completely in Browser, no Backend. It will be based on FileSystem Images.
